#### [u/Steven-ape](https://reddit.com/u/Steven-ape) has a lot of advice for intermediate players:

> Tips for logistics bots:
>
> - Bots are only useful for low throughput shipping.
> - Specific use cases: moving proliferator and warpers around your base.
> - They can also be useful to make a mall without too much spaghetti.
>
> Tips for using proliferator:
> - Skip yellow proliferator. Green proliferator is okay.
> - Do proliferate: proliferator, science matrix, fuel cells, graviton lenses, high end products.
> - Don't proliferate: accumulators, space warpers. You can skip low end products if you prefer.
> - In principle, proliferate intermediate items on the input side, end products on the output side.
> - It's not bad to proliferate everything, but the benefits are greatest for items that represent a lot of basic resources, and can be manufactured using not too many input items. Definitely proliferate production of things like plane filters, quantum chips and carrier rockets.
> - You can proliferate to reduce resources consumption, or to increase UPS and framerate. In the first case, proliferate for additional products always. In the second case, use "speed up" proliferation for low-end products.
> - Products that you might wish to skip proliferating, or use production speed-up on, are: all products that are made from just a single ore, as well as casimir crystals (the latter because they require so many proliferation charges while they are not actually that expensive to make).

#### [u/Steven-ape](https://reddit.com/u/Steven-ape) later added:

> - Get the deuteron power cells and make sure you have enough power
> - Make a better mall, one that builds all buildings in the game
> - Start organising your base more systematically
> - When you unlock purple science, explore the star cluster to find convenient rare resources, particularly organic crystals, fire ice and sulfuric acid.
