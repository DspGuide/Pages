## How is this Site Structured?

This site began with a [seemingly innocent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dyson_Sphere_Program/comments/179y1jp/what_are_your_dyson_sphere_program_pro_tips/) on Reddit, which got an overwhelming response and tons of great content.

## What is Dyson Sphere Program About?

## Getting Started

[u/The_Quackening](https://reddit.com/u/The_Quackening): 
> Set up assemblers that will build: belts, power poles, assemblers, and sorters.
>
> do this ASAP. You are going to need a lot of them, and hand crafting is WAY too slow.
>
> All you really need is a single assembler for each, in the time it takes you to build stuff, another stack will be done.
