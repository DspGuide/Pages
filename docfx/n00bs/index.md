> Set up assemblers that will build: belts, power poles, assemblers, and sorters.
>
> do this ASAP. You are going to need a lot of them, and hand crafting is WAY too slow.
>
> All you really need is a single assembler for each, in the time it takes you to build stuff, another stack will be done.

> Don't look up guides or especially blueprints. I wish I could replay this game for the first time again, Don't rob yourself of that.
>
> If youre on 1.0 resources, you have more resources than you know. It might feel like youre running out, but youre not and theres avenues of expansion.
>
> Dont be afaraid to scrap or abandon things. Don't be married to your first designs.
>
> You can automate making buildings. Automate everything. The replicator js a crutch that feels like it saves time, but it super does not.
