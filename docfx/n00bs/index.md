## How is this Site Structured?

This site began with a [seemingly innocent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dyson_Sphere_Program/comments/179y1jp/what_are_your_dyson_sphere_program_pro_tips/) on Reddit, which got an overwhelming response and tons of great content.

## What is Dyson Sphere Program About?

According to space.com, 

> A [Dyson Sphere](https://www.space.com/dyson-sphere.html) is a theoretical mega-engineering project that encircles a star with platforms orbiting in tight formation. It is the ultimate solution for living space and energy production, providing its creators ample surface area for habitation and the ability to capture every bit of solar radiation emanating from their central star.

[Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/) is a game about creating a Dyson Sphere from scratch as you arrive on an uninhabited world with the task of building the infrastructure and manufacturing capacity to build and launch components of the sphere into orbit around a star and then repeat the process throughout a small cluster of stars.

> I'd like to add to this have storages filled with stuff as well this way when you unlocked a new recipe for buildings or materials then you already got what you need instead of needing to adjust your resources output whenever I'd go to a new planet I usually had 50 solar panels ready to set down to cover any power needs

The important takeaway here is that it's important to set up assemblers to build some of the buildings such as conveyors to reduce the time spent replicating them in your mech.  Stockpiling them in storage is important, too and you need to devise a methodology for finding and retrieving them in  the early game before logistics bots are available.
